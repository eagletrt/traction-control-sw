# Workflow

## Compiling
Makefile contains some usefull commands that can be used to compile easily.
- `make build`
- `make run`
- `make format`
- `make bf` (build and format)
- `make restart` (restarts the service on the raspi)

To crosscompile follow the telemetry wiki.

## Changing behaviour
In **defines.h** there are some defines and variables that can be used to change the behaviour of the code.

## New or updated model
When an updated or new model must be integrated copy the files in **exported/new_or_updated_modes**.  
Matlab can generate variable names that are shared between different models, that code will not compile, so when generating check the options for the naming scheme, to add some name mangling.  
Update **CMakeLists.txt** adding the model source file to the **exported** library.  
Then compile again.  
___
To integrate a **new model** implement your own **model_set_data**, to copy the values received in can. Then in tine main loop call model_set_data and model_step.
